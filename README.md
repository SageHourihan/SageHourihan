## Hi there!👋🏻

I am a Software Engineer - working with EDI and developing B2B solutions.

I love building CLI tools in Python as well as designing and develop landing pages with HTML/CSS & Vanilla JS,

### Skills 👨🏼‍💻

Python is my language of choice for making scripts and tools but I can use Bash and Golang if the job calls for it. My experience covers frontend webdesign/development (HTML5/CSS3, SASS, JS), and SQL.
