## Hi there!👋🏻

I am a Software Engineer - working with EDI and developing B2B solutions.

I love building CLI tools in Python as well as designing and develop landing pages with HTML/CSS & Vanilla JS. I am interested in pentesting and CTFs and actively learning in this field.

### Skills 👨🏼‍💻

Python is my language of choice for making scripts and tools but I can use Bash and Golang if the job calls for it. My experience covers frontend webdesign/development (HTML5/CSS3, SASS, JS), and SQL.

### I am currently learning 💡

Currently I am learning about pentesting and CTFs. I am utalizing websites like TryHackMe, Vulnhub, and HackTheBox. CTFs and Bug Bountys are my recent obsession.

### Goals ☘️

_these are short and long term goals that I will (hopefully) update_

- Complete a CTF challenge without reading a walkthrough
- Submit a bug bounty and have it triaged and fixed
- Program more in Go
